# Auto Designer

A specification workspace that helps designers define design problem boundaries before AI generation. Specifications compile into hypothesis strategies that systematically explore the solution space. An agentic build engine then generates each variant across multiple LLM calls — breaking through single-response token limits.

Designers write structured specs. The compiler reasons about the exploration space. The agentic engine builds variants file-by-file. Everything connects on a visual node-graph canvas.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local  # add your API keys
pnpm dev                     # http://localhost:5173
```

### API Configuration

| Key | Where to get it | Required | What it does |
|-----|----------------|----------|--------------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) | For OpenRouter | Server-side only — proxied via Vite, never exposed to browser |
| `VITE_LMSTUDIO_URL` | Local (default: `http://192.168.252.213:1234`) | For LM Studio | Local inference endpoint |
| `VITE_LMSTUDIO_VISION_MODELS` | N/A | Optional | Comma-separated model ID substrings that support vision |

You can mix and match providers — e.g. OpenRouter Claude for compilation, LM Studio for generation. See `.env.example` for all options.

## Canvas Workflow

The primary interface is a visual node-graph canvas (`/canvas`, the default route):

1. **Input nodes** (left) — Design Brief, Existing Design, Research Context, Objectives & Metrics, Design Constraints
2. **Model node** — Connect to the Incubator or Hypotheses to configure which provider and model they use
3. **Incubator** — Connect input nodes and a Model node, then click Generate to produce hypothesis strategies
4. **Hypotheses** — Editable strategy cards. Connect a Model node and click Create to generate variants via the agentic engine
5. **Design System** (optional) — Connect to hypotheses to inject design tokens into generation
6. **Variants** — Rendered design previews with zoom, version navigation, and full-screen. Results accumulate across runs

Nodes connect left-to-right. Auto-layout arranges everything based on connections. Variants can connect back to Existing Design for iterative feedback loops (captures a screenshot automatically).

## Scripts

| `pnpm build` | Type-check and production build |
| `pnpm test` | Run unit tests (Vitest) |
| `pnpm lint` | Run ESLint |
| `pnpm preview` | Serve production build locally |
